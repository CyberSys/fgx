FGx is a cross-platform launcher for the FlightGear. It started with a Mac laucnher for OSx by a swiss `gral` pilot; hence the x in FGx,
but now targets windows, ubuntu and osx.

Its a GUI application written in c++/qt and allows a quick way to fire up the fgfs command with the options, and lots and lots of them.

The application is minimal in its options and a quick way to get up in the air.
