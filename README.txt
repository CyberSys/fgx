FGX - FREE AND OPEN SOURCE LAUNCHER FOR FLIGHTGEAR
--------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2-1beta

==== Requirements
Apples: Intel-based Mac, OSX 10.5.8 or later
Windows: no clue
Debian: no clue

Important: Does probably NOT WORK with FlightSimPro/ProSimFlight/FlightProSim. You use FGX at your own risk with software with "Pro" in the name! (There is no Warranty in general for GPL software, but we just want to prevent you from heavy pro crashes, huge pro damage of your pro computer, your pro house, your pro car, your pro wife, your pro dog, your pro bank and pro money, your whole little pro island. Use original Open Source FlightGear, you will get it for free and without "pro").

==== About ====
FGX is a qt-based c++ launcher for FlightGear. There is more than one launcher around for FlightGear like FGrun or others, intention for FGX was mainly to have fast and small launcher for OSX, starting the real and only free and Open Source Flight Simulator FlightGear within 5 seconds (also development versions and nightly builds). Since it makes no sense to have such a launcher only for one platform using qt, it became cross-platform and could be used also with Debian and Win.

The FGX project was started early 2011 by Yves Sablonier in Swiss Mountains, peering to another project started once by Pedro. Bright Pedro in Wales (there are mountains too) was enough of a git to go and check it out, then code a load of patches to its current state and do all needed changes, to get real code. Yves Sablonier tried to step down, but Pedro still needs him for the bug tracking, to get a good logo, and maybe for good manuals and documentation. So Yves Sablonier did not step down, but he is always one step behind.

==== License ====
All the code is under GPLv2 or later. LICENCE.txt and README.txt have to be included with every distribution. 
Please don’t bootleg, make loads of copies and flog them around. Do what you want and what GPL allows you, but never add only a "Pro" to make people believe you’re the pro and get some money for this three lying letters. The logo FGX logo is trademarked and patented under the creative commons and owned by Yves Sablonier, Zurich (unfortunately GPL does not cover free and open source artwork, that’s why Gral choose CC, until someone explains him how to protect artwork under GPL).

==== Thanks ====
First I send my BIG Thanks to Pedro, who decided to contribute and committed a new, fast and professional FGX after some days in eraly 2011. Second my thanks goes to ALL the FlightGear developers and associated projects. Without all this developers it would never be possible to have a cool, free, open source Flight Simulator available. 

(Beware of other distributions where you have to pay for, FlightGear is free, has a huge community, a living forum and wiki, it is THE ORIGINAL, and you will never get a better version than the original. When you find other statements, it’s just a well known lie.)
