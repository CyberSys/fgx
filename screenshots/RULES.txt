Pete says...

Need maybe around 10 images to eplxain the look and feel.. and that is requirement

All files to be jpeg, unless specifically reqired

These images are only going to apprear on website,, mainly

Keep the file sizes to a minimum eg < 30k or as min as necessary

Stick to one file name eg "aicraft.jpeg" or "settings.jpeg"

Dont create new files with aircraft-1.jpeg, or aicraft-windows-2015-one-foobang.jpeg

Instead overwrite old images with new ones, as features are added.. 
this will work as be step up the branches
